# Garage App

This is a little app, I decided to use react-native-web
instead of just web apis to demonstrate knowledge of react-native,
otherwise would've picked raw react-native or expo.

The results should be the same and the good thing is that this code is portable.

I would've loved to add more functionality, like websockets and spring animations,
but I don't really know what extension should this exercise have.

Anyways, here are the run instructions:

```bash
yarn # or npm i
yarn start # or npm run start
```
